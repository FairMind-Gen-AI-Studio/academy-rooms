# User Story 2: Meeting Room Filter
As a user, I want to filter meeting rooms based on capacity and available equipment so that I can find a suitable room quickly.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system should provide filters for capacity and available equipment.
2. Users should be able to apply these filters to update the list of available meeting rooms in real-time.
3. The system should display the number of matching rooms as filters are applied or removed.
**Additional Considerations:**
- Consider adding a search bar to filter rooms by name or other attributes.
- Implement a sorting feature based on room size, equipment, or distance from the user's location.
- Allow users to save their filter preferences for future use.
