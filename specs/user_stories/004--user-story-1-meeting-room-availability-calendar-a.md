# User Story 1: Meeting Room Availability Calendar
As a meeting organizer, I want to view a real-time calendar displaying the availability of meeting rooms, color-coded for booked, available, and tentative reservations, so that I can schedule meetings efficiently and avoid conflicts.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system should display a calendar view with meeting rooms listed on the side and dates along the top.
2. Each room should be color-coded based on its status: booked (red), available (green), and tentative (yellow).
3. The calendar should update in real-time to reflect any changes in reservations.
4. Users should be able to hover over or click on a room to view detailed information about the reservation, including the organizer, start and end times, and any notes.
5. The system should allow users to filter rooms by type (e.g., small, medium, large) or search for specific rooms.
6. The calendar should be customizable to display different time zones or work hours.
**Additional Considerations:**
- Consider adding a feature to send notifications or reminders for upcoming meetings.
- Implement a way to view and manage recurring meetings.
- Allow users to view and manage meeting rooms on a mobile device.
- Consider integrating with other calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) for seamless scheduling.
