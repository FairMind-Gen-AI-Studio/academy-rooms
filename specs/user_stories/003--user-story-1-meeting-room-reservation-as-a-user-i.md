# User Story 1: Meeting Room Reservation
As a user, I want to reserve a meeting room and invite guests so that I can schedule and manage my meetings efficiently.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system should display a list of available meeting rooms with their capacities and available equipment.
2. Users should be able to select a room, choose a date and time, and add internal and external participants.
3. The system should validate that the selected room is available at the chosen time.
4. The system should send automatic invitations to all invited participants.
5. The reservation should be displayed in the user's calendar and the meeting room's schedule.
**Additional Considerations:**
- Implement a feature to allow users to cancel or reschedule meetings.
- Consider sending reminders to participants before the meeting starts.
- Allow users to add or remove participants after the meeting has been scheduled.
